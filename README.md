Code sourcing:
Some of the code in this was either copied or written with the help of OpenAI/ChatGPT/Github CoPilot/the Intellicode API. This includes using the "current_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))" commands to retrieve the file paths, as I was unable to get around path errors otherwise, as well as changing how I was writing to the text file by using the commands in the code.
